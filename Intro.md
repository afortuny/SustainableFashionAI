# Intro and Motivation

We are regularly reminded of the impact of our food, transport and energy systems on the stability of our biodiverse systems. A few years ago, when I moved to the Sports Clothing industry, the main focus was on the working conditions of employes on the factories, but not so on the environmental impacts of the industry.

Here I would like to provide, in a short blink, what are the main impacts of the industry for the environment and how AI could be leveraged not only as a tool to sell more and better, but as an accelerator for the circularity of clothing.

# Facts about the impact of the industry

The following figures from [United Nations Environmental Programme and the Ellen Macarthur Foundation](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2019/09/23/costo-moda-medio-ambiente), make a good case for the urgency and importance of the industry to reduce global emissions, waste and water use:

* The industry is responsible 10 % of annual global carbon emissions, more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined. 
* 87 % Of the total fiber input is incinerated or disposed of in a landfill.
* 20 % of wastewater worldwide comes from fabric dyeing and treatment.
* 93 billion cubic meters of water used — enough to meet the consumption needs of five million people.
* 50 billion plastic bottles in microplastics released yearly
* [According to McKinsey, average consumers buy 60 percent more than they did in 2000, and keep it half as long](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/the-end-of-ownership-for-fashion-products)
* [According to Boston Consulting Group, the average garment is weared 10 times before disposal](http://media-publications.bcg.com/france/Pulse-of-the-Fashion-Industry2019.pdf)


A deep dive in the drivers of emissions show that [70% of the fashion industry’s emissions came from upstream activities such as materials production (40%), preparation and processing](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/retail/our%20insights/fashion%20on%20climate/fashion-on-climate-full-report.pdf). That means the in the actual design and production of products are the majority of emissions happening, which could be mitigated cheaply. [According to a study from Mckinsey, around 90% of the accelerated abatement can be delivered below a cost of around USD50 per tonne of GHG emissions](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/retail/our%20insights/fashion%20on%20climate/fashion-on-climate-full-report.pdf).

To understand what AI can do for a sustainable clothing industry, let's start by exploring how AI has been mainly used.

# AI common use cases in the fashion and clothing industry

A brief review of typical use cases for AI in fashion show that the focus is mainly on sales and profitability growth, while little on the implementation of circular fashion principles. With the exeption demand and supply chain optimization algorithms to reduce excess stock and cost of service, there are little known experiences at both industry and academia which goes beyond: dynamic pricing and stoc clearing, product recommendations, automatic designs and trend detection.

The following reviews found in medium support such claims: 

* https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/ai-and-machine-learning-for-fashion-industry-global-trends-benefits-3fe11a17849e
* https://medium.com/vsinghbisen/how-ai-is-changing-fashion-impact-on-the-industry-with-use-cases-76f20fc5d93f

On top of that, the employment of data experts hardly compensate for the risk of job losses due to automation, affecting worlwide  [60 million textile workers](https://fashionunited.com/global-fashion-industry-statistics). AI is likely to be used to replace humans in the production process, as [the wall street journal points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsSDI8wWAyQ).

But it is that all that AI can offer? job automation and a fashion that is faster, last less and keep polluting the planet at unprecedented rate? Probably not. We would like to offer ways in which AI could accelerate the implementation of a circular economy in the following dimensions:

# What AI can do to accelerate a truly circular fashion

*Improving Design and Raw materials selection*

1) AI can be used to design [long lasting garments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166361522001750). We can use product reviews and lab data to make predictions of the lasting of the products, supporting the creation of those with the large life cycles.
2) AI can be used to create truly [unique articles](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/learning-product-similarity-in-e-commerce-using-a-supervised-approach-525d734afd99): leverage computer vision, material and fit data we can identify unique products and make leaner offering.
3) AI can identify those [lasting materials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844022020229) with proven track record in the industry of functionality, good and durability...to make safe substitutions and use less sustainable options.
4) Using Value based creation and pricing to create valuable and profitable products (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296322006531) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162522003316)
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652620357000)
6) Supporting the creation of designs which are easy to recycle or [decompose naturally](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41570-019-0124-0).

*Eliminating excess stock and waste*

1) AI can be used to reduce excess stocks via better [demand forecasting](https://www.mdpi.com/2571-9394/4/2/31/htm) and [stock optimization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221721006111)
2) Leveraging [pre-order models](https://www.thezoereport.com/fashion/made-to-order-clothing)
3) Leveraging renting and [second life channels](https://electricrunway.com/how-thredup-is-using-ai-to-create-a-more-circular-fashion-future/)

*At the delivery stage*

1) AI can be used to reduce returns by making very accurate [product recommendations](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-66103-8) or [fit mapping](https://towardsdatascience.com/would-this-clothing-fit-me-5c3792b7a83f)
2) AI can be used to find [similar replacements](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/cosine-similarity-between-products-to-recommend-similar-products-3b94bf6e30ba) that are close to the point of sale to avoid flight shipping
3) Using [Green Last Mile AI power logistics](https://www.climatechange.ai/blog/2022-10-11-grant-green-last-mile) to deliver products with renewable energy

*Changing consumer behaviours and policy*

1) AI can help to [understand what leads to longer use of garments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666784321000231) to take product design or policy interventions
2) AI can provide insights of the [values that drive sustainability clothing choices that is both real and perceived](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622038938#tbl5)
3) AI can test empirically [theoretically appealing policies to enable sustainable clothing via durability standards or others](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800922000209)
4) BlockChain technology and AI can be used to [scale life cycle management assestments for each product](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652622006813)
5) AI can be used the detect and track [green washing](https://www.rte.ie/lifestyle/living/2021/1116/1260326-science-to-the-rescue-ai-to-fight-greenwashing/)


# Would AI in fashion face the Jevon's paradox? 

For those who do not know, the [Jevons paradox](https://medium.com/codon-consulting/tackling-climate-change-with-machine-learning-the-jevons-paradox-c22ff6077578) is often used to explain that without suficciency, efficiency gains are consume up by an increased use of the resource. If we make our fashion supply chains leaner, our products affordable and durable, will that stop us from buying and hence polluting more?

It is hard to believe, while looking at the evidence at the micro and macro level, to expect further increases in production without a subsequent increase in water use, waste creation, energy demand, material demands and the like... 

While there are many unexploited opportunities to create an organic, long lasting, highly circular fashion and textile industry, leveraging the power of AI, we would like to acknowledge the need to have a definition of [enough](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266678432100022X), and the increasingly tense match between sustainability and shareholder value maximization. 

Business needs to be profitable to become financially viable, but how much is growth compatible to planetary boundaries?
