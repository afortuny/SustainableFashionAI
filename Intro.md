# Intro and Motivation

We are regularly reminded of the impact of our food, transport and energy systems on the stability of our biodiversity. A few years ago, when I moved to the Sports Clothing industry, the main concern was on the working conditions of employes on the factories, but not so on the environmental impacts of the industry. In the last years, environmental concerns has been added to the social ones

Here I would like to motivate the importance of the fashion industry in climate change impacts and propose a refocus of AI, not only as a tool to sell more and better, but as an accelerator for the circularity of the sector.

# Facts about the impact of the industry

The following figures from [United Nations Environmental Programme and the Ellen Macarthur Foundation](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2019/09/23/costo-moda-medio-ambiente), make a good case for the urgency and importance to reduce global emissions, water use and waste:

* The industry is responsible 10 % of annual global carbon emissions, more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined. 
* 87 % Of the total fiber input is incinerated or disposed of in a landfill.
* 20 % of wastewater worldwide comes from fabric dyeing and treatment.
* 93 billion cubic meters of water used
* 50 billion plastic bottles in microplastics released yearly
* [According to McKinsey, average consumers buy 60 percent more than they did in 2000, and keep it half as long](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/the-end-of-ownership-for-fashion-products)
* [According to Boston Consulting Group, the average garment is weared 10 times before disposal](http://media-publications.bcg.com/france/Pulse-of-the-Fashion-Industry2019.pdf)


With such numbers one could ask what is the most effective way to reduce industry impacts.
A study of the drivers of emissions show that [40% of the fashion industryâ€™s emissions came from upstream activities such as materials production (40%), being the remaining preparation and processing.]( https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/retail/our%20insights/fashion%20on%20climate/fashion-on-climate-full-report.pdf). That means the in the actual design and production of products are the majority of emissions happening, which could be mitigated cheaply. [According to a study from Mckinsey, around 90% of the accelerated abatement can be delivered below a cost of around USD50 per tonne of GHG emissions](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/retail/our%20insights/fashion%20on%20climate/fashion-on-climate-full-report.pdf).

To understand what AI can do for a sustainable clothing industry, let's start by exploring how AI has been mainly used as of now.

# AI common use cases in the fashion and clothing industry

A brief review of typical use cases for AI in fashion show that the focus is mainly on sales and profitability growth, while little on the implementation of circular fashion principles. With the exeption demand and supply chain optimization algorithms to reduce excess stock and cost of service, there are few experiences at both industry and academia which goes beyond: dynamic pricing and excess stock clearing, product recommendations to increase conversion, automatic designs and trend detection.

The following reviews found in medium support such claims: 

* https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/ai-and-machine-learning-for-fashion-industry-global-trends-benefits-3fe11a17849e
* https://medium.com/vsinghbisen/how-ai-is-changing-fashion-impact-on-the-industry-with-use-cases-76f20fc5d93f

On top of that, the employment of AI professionals will hardly compensate for the job losses due to automation, affecting worlwide  [60 million textile workers](https://fashionunited.com/global-fashion-industry-statistics). AI is likely to be used to replace humans in the production process, as [the wall street journal points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsSDI8wWAyQ).

But it is that all that AI can offer? job automation and a fashion that is faster, last less and keep polluting the planet at unprecedented rate? Probably not. We would like to offer ways in which AI could accelerate the implementation of a circular economy in the following dimensions:

# What AI can do to accelerate a truly circular fashion

In the following, we provide a long but not exhaustive list of use cases were AI can be used to make the industry more sustainable in all stages of the value creation and use, including the potential role of consumer behaviour change and policy supported by AI.


*Improving Design and Raw materials selection*

1) AI can be used to design [long lasting garments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166361522001750). We can use product reviews and lab data to make predictions of the lasting of the products, supporting the creation of those with the largest life cycles.
2) AI can be used to create truly [unique articles](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/learning-product-similarity-in-e-commerce-using-a-supervised-approach-525d734afd99): leveraging computer vision, material and fit data we can identify unique products and make a leaner offering that is easy to operate.
3) Instead of taking a profit based approach to design and pricing, we can use perceived value. This can support the creation of valuable and profitable products (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296322006531) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162522003316)
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652620357000)
6) Leverage Reinforcement Learning and other methods to create designs that are easy to repair, recycle or [decompose naturally](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41570-019-0124-0).

*Eliminating excess stock and waste*

1) AI can be used to reduce excess stocks via better [demand forecasting](https://www.mdpi.com/2571-9394/4/2/31/htm) and [stock optimization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221721006111)

*At the delivery stage*

1) AI can be used to reduce returns by making very accurate [product recommendations](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-66103-8) or [fit mapping](https://towardsdatascience.com/would-this-clothing-fit-me-5c3792b7a83f)
2) AI can be used to find [similar replacements](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/cosine-similarity-between-products-to-recommend-similar-products-3b94bf6e30ba) that are close to the point of sale to avoid flight shipping
3) Using [Green Last Mile AI power logistics](https://www.climatechange.ai/blog/2022-10-11-grant-green-last-mile) to deliver products with renewable energy

*Changing consumer behaviours and policy*

1) AI can help to [understand what leads to longer use of garments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666784321000231) on consumers to take product design or policy interventions
2) AI can provide insights of the [values that drive sustainability clothing choices that is both real and perceived](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622038938#tbl5)
3) AI can test empirically, [theoretically appealing policies to enable sustainable clothing via durability standards or others](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800922000209)
4) BlockChain technology and AI can be used to [scale life cycle management assestments for each product](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652622006813)
5) AI can be used the detect and track [green washing claims](https://www.rte.ie/lifestyle/living/2021/1116/1260326-science-to-the-rescue-ai-to-fight-greenwashing/)


# Challenges for the implementation of AI for the circular economy

We identify relatively little research and applications at the intersection of AI and climate mitigation. As with early stages of other implementations of AI, **data gathering** is a not sufficiently fullfilled prerequisite for an extensive use of AI in circular fashion.

Another challenge is that given the **explosion of greenwashing**, the usage of machine learning to assess the footprint at a product level and make any sustainability claim without human supervision gets a lot of resistance, despite being more accurate than manually inputed claims. In contrast to that, the data requirements of processing of getting a **complete life cycle analysis is rarely going to scale** for the tens of thousands of products created by large fashion companies every season, if not every couple of weeks.

In the future, the **regulatory frameworks implemented at least at european level will require companies to provide detailed and accurate reports of their footprints** and in the fashion industry the responsability towars used textiles is going to put significant challenges on their data and information systems, that will require the implementation of new technologies, like blockchain to increase very granular visibility.

It remains an open question whether the **current inflation levels seen worlwide will change consumption patterns to longer lasting products** and hence large long term savings **or towards cheaper options sacrificing footprint and circularity**. Strong communication and adequate regulation could shift consumption to the former.

Last but not least, many of the lead firms are **stake holder own, and the pressure to keep growing makes any overall footprint reduction more challenging**, even with extensive circularity additions. It is threfore an open challenge if the [Jevons paradox](https://medium.com/codon-consulting/tackling-climate-change-with-machine-learning-the-jevons-paradox-c22ff6077578) will happen if circularity is not implemented without sufficiency. If we make our fashion supply chains leaner, our products affordable and durable, will that stop us from buying and hence polluting more?

None of those challenges are not present in other industries and there **are many industries such as energy, agriculture and forestry, where AI has been successfully implemented to reduce overall emissions at scale**. We do believe the time for circular fashion power by AI has come.
