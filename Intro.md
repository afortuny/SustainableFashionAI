We are regularly remind of the impact of our food, transport and energy systems in the stability of our biodiverse systems. A few years ago, when I moved to the Sports
Clothing industry, the main focus was on the working conditions of employes on the factories, but not so on the environmental impacts of the industry.

Here I would like to provide, in a short blink, a few facts about the industry from which we should ensure fair payment and safe working conditions for all, but also
and industry that works within planetary boundaries and engage into the complex circular economy setting.

The following figures come from the [United Nations Environmental Programme and the Ellen Macarthur Foundation](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2019/09/23/costo-moda-medio-ambiente):

* Responsible for 10 % of annual global carbon emissions, more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined. 
* 87 % Of the total fiber input is incinerated or disposed of in a landfill.
* 20 % of wastewater worldwide comes from fabric dyeing and treatment.
* Uses 93 billion cubic meters of water — enough to meet the consumption needs of five million people.
* Releases the equivalent of 50 billion plastic bottles in microplastics
* [According to McKinsey, average consumers buy 60 percent more than they did in 2000, and keep it half as long](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/the-end-of-ownership-for-fashion-products)
* [According to Boston Consulting Group, the average garment is weared 10 times before disposal](http://media-publications.bcg.com/france/Pulse-of-the-Fashion-Industry2019.pdf)

With that in mind, it is clear that there is a need to reduce its emissions, water use, waste and product according to circular economy principles.

A deep dive in the drivers of emissions show that [70% of the fashion industry’s emissions came from upstream activities such as materials production, preparation and processing](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/retail/our%20insights/fashion%20on%20climate/fashion-on-climate-full-report.pdf),
. That means the in the actual design and production of products are the majority of emissions happening. Around 90% of the accelerated abatement can be delivered below a cost of around USD50 per tonne of GHG emissions.
