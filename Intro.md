We are regularly remind of the impact of our food, transport and energy systems in the stability of our biodiverse systems. A few years ago, when I moved to the Sports
Clothing industry, the main focus was on the working conditions of employes on the factories, but not so on the environmental impacts of the industry.

Here I would like to provide, in a short blink, a few facts about the industry from which we should ensure fair payment and safe working conditions for all, but also
and industry that works within planetary boundaries and engage into the complex circular economy setting.

The following figures come from the [United Nations Environmental Programme and the Ellen Macarthur Foundation](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2019/09/23/costo-moda-medio-ambiente):

* Responsible for 10 % of annual global carbon emissions, more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined. 
* 87 % Of the total fiber input is incinerated or disposed of in a landfill.
* 20 % of wastewater worldwide comes from fabric dyeing and treatment.
* Uses 93 billion cubic meters of water — enough to meet the consumption needs of five million people.
* Releases the equivalent of 50 billion plastic bottles in microplastics
* [According to McKinsey, average consumers buy 60 percent more than they did in 2000, and keep it half as long](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/the-end-of-ownership-for-fashion-products)
* [According to Boston Consulting Group, the average garment is weared 10 times before disposal](http://media-publications.bcg.com/france/Pulse-of-the-Fashion-Industry2019.pdf)

With that in mind, it is clear that there is a need to reduce its emissions, water use, waste and product according to circular economy principles.

A deep dive in the drivers of emissions show that [70% of the fashion industry’s emissions came from upstream activities such as materials production (40%), preparation and processing](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/retail/our%20insights/fashion%20on%20climate/fashion-on-climate-full-report.pdf),
. That means the in the actual design and production of products are the majority of emissions happening. Around 90% of the accelerated abatement can be delivered below a cost of around USD50 per tonne of GHG emissions.

In this article, we are aiming to understand how AI can help to make this industry more sustainable. Let's start what the industry is normally using AI for.

A brief review of what are typical use cases for AI in fashion show that the focus is mainly on sales and profitability growth, while little on the implementation
of circular fashion principles. With the exeption of the usage of demand and supply optimization algorithms to reduce excess stock, there are little known experiences at both industry and academia which goes beyond: pricing, markdown, product recommendations, automatic designs, rapid creation.

The following summaries found in medium support such claim:

Garment creation is a labor intensive activity, [employing 60 million workers worldwide](https://fashionunited.com/global-fashion-industry-statistics), and if it is subject to severe automatition, which potentially large job losses, as [the wall street journal points](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsSDI8wWAyQ).

But it is that all that AI can offer? job automation and a fashion that is faster, last less and keep polluting the planet at unprecedented rate? Probably not. We would like to offer ways in which AI could accelerate the implementation of a circular economy in the following dimensions:

* Improving what we design
1) AI can be used to design [long lasting garments](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166361522001750). We can use product reviews and lab data to make predictions of the lasting of the products, supporting the creation of those with the large life cycles.
2) AI can be used to create truly unique articles (Adidas research): leverage computer vision, material and fit data we can identify unique products and make leaner offering.
3) AI can identify those sustainable materials with proven track record in the industry of functionality, good and durability...to make safe substitutions for the traditional less sustainable options.(Adidas research, trail running review dataset request pending)
4) Using Value based creation and pricing to create valuable and profitable products (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296322006531) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162522003316)
5) Supporting the creation of designs which are easy to recycle or decompose naturally

* Eliminating excess stock and waste

1) AI can be used to reduce excess stocks via better demand forecasting and stock optimization
2) Leveraging pre-order models ?
3) Leveraging renting and [second life channels](https://electricrunway.com/how-thredup-is-using-ai-to-create-a-more-circular-fashion-future/)  ?

* At the delivery stage
1) AI can be used to reduce returns by making very accurate size/fit/product recommendations
2) AI can be used to find similar replacements that are close to the point of sale to avoid flight shipping
